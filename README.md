# Study on association of COVID-19 vaccination with risks of hospitalization and mortality due to cardiovascular and other diseases

# Abstract 

**Background**   Vaccines for COVID-19 represent a breakthrough in the fight against the pandemic. However, worries about adverse effects have led to vaccine hesitancy in some people. On the other hand, as COVID-19 may be associated with a range of sequelae, it is possible that vaccines may protect against hospitalization and mortality of various diseases.

**Methods**    We leveraged a large prospective cohort, the UK-Biobank (UKBB), and studied associations of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination (BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca) with hospitalization and mortalities from cardiovascular and other diseases (N=180,727). Multivariable Cox and Poisson regression was conducted controlling for main confounders. For hospitalizations, we also conducted separate analysis for new-onset and recurrent cases. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were also included as outcome. 

**Results**    We observed that COVID-19 vaccination (at least one dose) was associated with lower risks of hospitalizations from stroke (hazard ratio [HR]=0.371, 95% CI: 0.254-0.543, p=3.36e-7), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (HR=0.485, 95% CI: 0.292-0.804, p=4.99e-3), dementia (HR=0.207, 95% CI 0.091-0.470; p=1.66e-4) and non-COVID-19 pneumonia (HR=0.482, 95% CI 0.313-0.742; p=9.18e-4). Regarding mortality, an association with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was observed, as well as lower mortality from several diseases including stroke, coronary artery disease(CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and dementia. There is no evidence that vaccination was associated with increased hospitalization/fatality from any specific disorders. 

**Conclusions**    Taken together, this study provides further support to the safety and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, and such benefits may extend beyond reduction of infection risk or severity per se. As an observational study, causal relationship cannot be concluded and further replications are required to verify the findings.
